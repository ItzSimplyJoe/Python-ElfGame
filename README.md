## Game outline
Your are in charge of a Christmas tree business, you have 12 elves that work for you cutting down trees and bringing them back for sale. You have the 25 days of advent to make the biggest profit.

### Days 1 - 17 
Each day you must choose whether to send your elves to the ‘Nearby Woods’ where trees are worth £10 or the ‘Faraway Forest’ where trees are worth £20.  However, elves will not be able to get to the ‘Faraway Forest’ if there is a blizzard and therefore bring no trees back.  There is a 1/3 chance of there being a blizzard. 

### Days 18 - 25
The ‘Big Mountain Pass’ is now complete, this gives you the opportunity to send your elves to the ‘Forest Far Beyond’, trees here are so big and beautiful they are worth £50.  So now you have the opportunity to send elves to the ‘Nearby Woods’, the ‘Faraway Forest’ and the ‘Forest Far Beyond’.  Take care though if you send your elves to the ‘Forest Far Beyond’ and there is a blizzard you will lose those elves. Fear not you can buy them back but at a premium!
